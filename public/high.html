                <p class="bort">
                    This took place last year, May 2024, it's my first time going into Boracay and it was fun! I had Fun
                    even though beaches aren't my thing. The beaches were clean and it's so pleasing to look at, the locals are
                    nice and they're very approachable, even the tourists are so approachable as well and they're all so fucking hot.
                    It's my first time to ride an airplane and i was so excited. I was
                    with my family and it's a milestone for us, we're looking forward to our next trip in Boracay.

                <p class="bort">
                    As the name suggests, this is last Christmas 2024, this is probably the best Christmas i had so far
                    because we celebrated it with my cousins and aunts (My aunts are actually around the same age as me).
                    This was so fun because i got to spend Christmas with my some of my favorite cousins and we went to 
                    Baguio city, the Christmas capital of the Philippines, i'm looking forward to celebrating Christmas with
                    them in other countries as well.
